# A tribute to the artwork of Duane Dalton

This is a passion project merging my love for music, poster design, and CSS.
All artwork credit goes to [Duane Dalton](http://duanedalton.com/) and his amazing [Album Anatomy](http://duanedalton.com/Album-Anatomy) project.

## Goals

Recreate as many of Duane's posters using only HTML/CSS and SVG for graphic content.

### 1. Learn

I wanted to create a side project to get super comfortable with CSS Grid. Duane's work is a perfect candidate for the new layout specification. I have been suing SVG consistently for a few years, but there is so much more to learn!

### 2. Keep it honest

The original designs, destined for print output, all follow portrait dimensions. The idea is for the viewer to feel as though they can enjoy the designs in any aspect ratio. I will take minimal amounts of creative freedom to allow the layout to adapt to as many viewports as possible. The goal is to keep the artist's original vision intact.

### 3. Keep it coming

I will do my best to release a new poster once or twice a month. This is a side gig and some of Duane's designs are more complex than others.

## Where can I see them?

### Run the project locally

- git clone
- gulp command

### Check them out on Codepen

I will add links to each new codepen project as they are released

- Codepen link

### Twitter
